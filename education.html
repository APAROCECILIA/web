       <p> I graduated from kindergaten in 2007 at <strong>Gods' Glory Nursery School</strong> and picked on my primary studies from 
        <strong> St. James Biina Primary School</strong> but unfortunately i couldn't complete my primary four because that is when
         suddenly shifted to Bukoto and i had to miss my second term results.</p>
         <p>I was taken to<strong> Shimoni Demonstration School</strong> to complete my primary studies. 
         </p>

            In 2014, I completed primary Seven and I continued to <strong>Kololo Senior Secondary School </strong>where i completed 
            O & A level studies and apparently I am persuing my first degree in Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering.
