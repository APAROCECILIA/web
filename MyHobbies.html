   <h1><b>** MY INTERESTS**</b> </h1>
    
<br>
   <p><b>Playing table tennis</b></p>
   <p>This is an activity that I used to do during my high school and actually was introduced to me by a friend with 
      whom I studied with at Kololo Senior Secondary School. I quit playing it during  UNEB examinations and I couldn't get an opportunity to play
      in my team after the examinations.
   </p>
  <br>
   <p><b>Jogging</b></p>
   <p>This is one of my favourites that I do on a weekly basis. I realised that I spend most of my time in reading
      books and making research in my field of Software Engineering and I hardly find time to stretch therfore, I decide to have jogging as my 
      weekly  acitivity that keeps me physically and mentally fit. 
   </p>
   <br>
   <p><b>Singing</b></p>
   <p>I love singing and listening to calm music that appeals to my mind like praise and worship songs, country music 
      and at times I like listening to loffy music especially during typing , just turns me on!! 
   </p>
   <br>
   <p><b>Traveling</b></p>
   <p>I have actually not done this so much ever since I started my higher studies because I have limited time 
   but travelling to me is like an adventure, I love nature like the rivers, mountains, forests and the wild animals.

   <p><b>Typing</b></p>

   <p>This is an activity that I came to appreciate during my work days earlier, and I am glad that I am in a field that
      actually requires me to type a whole lot of stuff like my course works, my codes in the different languages
      and just excites me daily.
