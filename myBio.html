       <p>I was born on 1st June, 2001 from Naguru Hospital. I am the second child of Mr. Anywar Paco Edward and 
        Mrs. Anywar Grace.</p> 
       <p>we are three children at home and apparently we stay at Bukoto  Mulimira Zone where my father built a 
        a house.</p> 
        <p>we have  stayed in this place for a period of 12 years, we shifted to this place when I was still in my
            primary four.</p>
            <p>My village is in Kitgum Distrinct, where the Notherners of Uganda originate. i am particularly a proud Acholi Lady.</p>
